# removeDuplicatesFromSortedArray
This is a Leet Code problem I am working on.

The problem is to remove duplicate values in a sorted array 
and replace them with a underscore at the end of the array

Given example A: 
	input array  = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
	output array = [1, 2, 3, 4, _, _]

Given example B: 
	input array  = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6]
	output array = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, _, _]

Note: that the underscores always go at the end of the array and need to equal 
     the number of duplicate values found in the array.
